        <h1>1. Cleanser</h1>
    <p> A good facial cleanser is the cornerstone of any effective skincare routine. It washes away impurities, excess oil, and may remove makeup, so they won’t clog pores. However, everyone’s skin is different and has its own needs, making it important to choose the best facial cleanser for your skin type. Once you identify your skin type, you'll be armed with the knowledge to find the right formula to effectively cleanse, nourish, and help protect your skin without disrupting your skin barrier.</p>
    <h1>2. Antioxidant cream, serum, oil or moisturizer</h1>
    <p> You’re looking for something that contains antioxidants such as vitamins C or E or ferulic acid. Studies show antioxidants can hydrate and brighten your skin. They also offer protection from molecules in our environment (called free radicals) that can damage your skin.</p>
    <h1>3. Sunscreen:</h1>
    <p>Use a product with at least SPF 30 to protect your skin from ultraviolet radiation. The cream you put on in the previous step — or the concealer or foundation you’re going to put on next — might already contain this. If it doesn’t, apply a separate facial sunscreen. I recommend a sunscreen with either iron oxide, zinc oxide or titanium dioxide in the ingredients.</p>

    <h1>1. Cleanser:</h1>
    <p>You can use the gentle cleanser you use in the morning or a different one that’s more targeted toward your skin type. Acne-prone skin might do well with a face wash that contains salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide, Dr. Khetarpal says. Someone who’s in their 30s or 40s might opt for something with an alpha hydroxy acid, such as glycolic acid, that brightens the skin and can help with pigmentation.</p>
    <h1>2. Toner (optional): </h1>
    <p>Depending on the formula, toner is usually infused with skincare ingredients to jumpstart the skin-renewal process. In addition, toning can remove any residue your cleanser may have missed. It can help get rid of any dirt or impurities that have collected on your skin overnight or during the day.</p>
    <h1>3. Night cream/moisturizer</h1>
    <p> As a final step in your nightly routine, apply a vitamin A-based cream to help build new collagen and keep your skin looking young. Dr. Khetarpal recommends one that contains tretinoin, retinol or adapalene. If it dries out your skin at all, you can add a moisturizer that contains ceramide or hyaluronic acid on top.</p>
